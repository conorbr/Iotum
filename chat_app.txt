To create a web based chat application I would start with rails,
I would throw up a rails application with devise to handle the
use authentication. I would create the home and chatroom controllers
a user will have many chatrooms subsequently a chatroom will have
many users and be able to invite users registered in the application
to join the chatroom.

the invitations would be sent out the users using ActionMailer to send out
invites to join the chatroom. I would create a token controller to handle
unique invite tokens. To handle the messenger I would use web sockets ActionCable
and ajax calls to allow for real time messages to be sent. Each message
would be stored in the messages model with a timestamp, user_id, and chatroom_id

as far as hosting AWS would work well with scaling in mind making use of the load
balancer. Building on this a mobile application would complement this application
using react-native would make it possible to quickly establish a mobile app.
This would require a different form of authentication as devise uses CSRF tokens
and API applications wouldn't make good use of session tokens. JSON web tokens
would be a good route to take for authentication from outside applications.
